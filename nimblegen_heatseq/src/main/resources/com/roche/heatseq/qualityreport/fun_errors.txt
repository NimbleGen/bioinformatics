Houston, we've had a problem.
Great Scott! We have an issue.
DON'T PANIC ... There has been a problem. 
I've given her all she's got captain and it's not working.
We're sorry.  There has been an error.
Unfortunately we've ran into a little hiccup.
It seems as though we've hit a little bump in the road.
