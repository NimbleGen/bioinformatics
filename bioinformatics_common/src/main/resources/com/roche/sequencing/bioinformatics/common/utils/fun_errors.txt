Houston, we've had a problem.
Great Scott! We have an issue.
DON'T PANIC ... There has been a problem. 
I've given her all she's got captain and it's not working.
We're sorry.  There has been an error.
Unfortunately we've ran into a little hiccup.
It seems as though we've hit a little bump in the road.
Danger, Will Robinson! Danger! We have a problem.
Sorry, Something went wrong when executing the application.
Unfortunately it appears that we've hit a little snag.
There has been a problem.  What's the problem?   Dave, I think you know what the problem is just as well as I do.  What are you talking about, HAL?
There has been a complication.  Look Dave, I can see you're really upset about this. I honestly think you ought to sit down calmly, take a stress pill, and think things over.
There has been a problem with the application.  I know I've made some very poor decisions recently, but I can give you my complete assurance that my work will be back to normal. I've still got the greatest enthusiasm and confidence in the mission. And I want to help you.
